#### Your team's hackathon idea in One sentence:
##### ReLink is a digital identity platform that helps unhoused individuals build trust, access housing, healthcare, and employment by giving them a secure, verifiable ID that showcases their participation in community programs, and their personal progress.

## ReLink - A Digital Identity for Dignity and Opportunity

## Overview

**ReLink** is a digital identity and credentialing platform that empowers unhoused and under-documented individuals to access **housing, healthcare, and employment** by providing them with a **secure, verifiable digital profile** that records their participation in community programs, trainings, and verified achievements.

By turning fragmented personal histories into **trustworthy digital records**, ReLink rebuilds the bridge between individuals and opportunity.

---

### Inspiration

Thousands of people, including **veterans, displaced workers, and the unhoused**, struggle to prove their identity, skills, or work history, barriers that prevent them from obtaining jobs, housing, or even basic services.

**ReLink** was born from a simple idea:  
> *Everyone deserves a second chance and a way to prove they’re ready for it.*

We aim to create a **credible digital bridge** between people and the systems that serve them, enabling recognition, trust, and inclusion.

---

### System Design

### **Workflow**

#### 1. Onboarding
- Conduct outreach or “ReLink Camps” in partnership with shelters, NGOs, and local authorities.  
- Collect biometric or photo verification (fingerprint, facial ID, etc.).  
- Assign each participant a **unique ReLink ID** and QR card.  

#### 2. Document Upload
- Users can **digitize and store** essential personal documents (IDs, certificates, letters).  
- Integration with **DigiLocker** or secure repositories for document management.  
- Verified data is categorized, timestamped, and encrypted.

#### 3. Skill Development & Training
- Partner with local training programs and community centers.  
- New skill certifications and completions are **automatically added** to user profiles.  
- Introduce **gamified milestones and badges** to encourage participation.  

#### 4. Building Credibility
Each user’s profile evolves into a **digital resume** that includes:
- Verified employment history  
- Skill certifications  
- Rehabilitation or training completions  
- Endorsements or letters of recommendation  
- Optional indicators like veteran or disability status  

A **credibility score** (stars/badges) summarizes verified progress and reliability.

#### 5. Access & Verification
- Employers, landlords, or healthcare providers can **scan a QR code** to view a simplified trust profile (no sensitive data).  
- Partners can verify credentials through **secure APIs**.  

#### 6. Deployment & Scale
- Pilot in one city to test user flow and integrations.  
- Long-term goal: integrate with **HMIS (Homeless Management Information System)** or equivalent public datasets.  


## Impact

ReLink turns *recognition* into empowerment.  
It helps individuals without formal IDs or records to:
- Access housing and employment  
- Receive consistent healthcare  
- Regain dignity and societal trust  

For organizations, it provides a **data-driven, verifiable ecosystem** for social inclusion.

---

## Vision

> *To create a trusted, portable identity for every individual, enabling access, recognition, and reintegration through verified digital credibility.*

ReLink redefines identity not as a document, but as **proof of growth, trust, and belonging.**

---

## Future Roadmap

- MVP: Centralized ID creation and verification  
- Integration with skill training APIs and NGOs  
- Healthcare record linking (with consent-based access)  
- Predictive analytics for employment matching  
- County-wide rollout and policy integration
